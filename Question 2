# 1.Load the data from “college.csv” that has attributes collected about private and public colleges
# for a particular year. We will try to predict the private/public status of the college from other attributes.

# 2.Use LabelEncoder to encode the target variable in to numerical form and split the data such that 20% of the data is set aside fortesting.

# 3.Fit a linear svm from scikit learn and observe the accuracy.[Hint:Use Linear SVC

# 4.Preprocess the data using StandardScalar and fit the same model again and observe the change in accuracy.
[Hint: Refer to scikitlearn’s preprocessing methods]

# 5.Use scikit learn’s gridsearch to select the best hyperparameter for a non-linear SVM,identify the model with
# best score and its parameters.
[Hint: Refer to model_selection module of Scikit learn]
